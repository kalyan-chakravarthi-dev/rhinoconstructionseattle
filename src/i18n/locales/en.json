    "storyTitle": "Our Story",
    "storyP1": "Rhino Remodeler was founded in 2003 with a simple mission: to provide Seattle homeowners with honest, quality home repair and renovation services they can trust. What started as a small operation with just two dedicated craftsmen has grown into one of the Puget Sound's most respected home improvement companies.",
    "storyP2": "Our founder, John Smith, began his career as a carpenter's apprentice at age 18. After years of working for large contractors and seeing how customers were often treated as just another job number, he knew there had to be a better way. He envisioned a company that would treat every home as if it were their own, combining old-school craftsmanship with modern techniques and genuine customer care.",
    "storyP3": "Today, that vision lives on in every project we undertake. From kitchen remodels that transform daily life to emergency repairs that save the day, our team of 15+ licensed professionals carries forward the same commitment to excellence that built our reputation over two decades ago.",
